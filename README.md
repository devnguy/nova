# Nova

A terminal based, _edgy_, adventure game written in C++

This was my final project for the second intro to CS course. For some reason
when I wrote this, I decided against WASD movement. This was also before my
newfound relationship with vim movement. Either would have made more sense.

```
git clone https://github.com/devnguy/nova.git
cd nova
make
./nova
```

## How to play

Survive and escape the Imperius. Time limit is measured in steps.

```
@: Player
-: Door
!: Objective
$: Hostile
*: Supply Cache
```
